# Introductory Scene

The game opens with the professor introducing themselves in a quirky, friendly way.

[Prof enters the scene]

**Prof**: "Ah, there you are! Welcome, welcome! I'm Professor PY. This lab is full of wonders and gizmos, but Python is the key to making it all work."

[Prof chuckles or does something quirky, like checking a dusty old book or adjusting their glasses]

**Prof**: "To get started, why don't you head over to that *Terminal*? Just click it—I'll be right here to help you through. Ready? Let's bring this lab to life!"

[The terminal glows or highlights to indicate it's clickable. Once the player clicks, the first level begins.]

# Level 1: Hello, World!

[Prof reappears on screen.] (Maybe just the avatar and a speech bubble)

**Prof**: "Ah, the classic! Before you can command the lab, you've got to make sure it listens! Let's start by printing a simple message. Type exactly this: `print('Hello Lab.')` and hit enter. This command tells the computer to say something. Give it a go!"

The player types the command and hits enter. The terminal responds with 'Hello Lab.' printed on the screen.

The player exits the terminal and returns to the professor. The professor gives feedback. (full body)

**Prof**: "See? You've just spoken to the lab! Well done, truly. Now, I think you're ready for the real work. How about we get you officially set up in the system? Every scientist needs an ID, after all."

**Prof**: "Head over to the Personal ID Station next. You'll enter a few details—just a bit of data for our records—and the lab will generate your official ID card. Ready?"

# Level 2: Variables and Types

[Prof's avatar appears in the screen.]

**Prof**: "Ah, the Personal ID Station—my favorite gadget. So, here's how it works: every bit of information you enter—your name, age, even if you're a member of the lab—is stored as a variable. Each variable has its own type, depending on what it holds."

[Prof gestures animatedly]

**Prof**: "For example, your name is a ‘*string*,' which means it's text. Your age, well, that's a whole number or an ‘*integer*'—like 25. And then there's your height and weight, which are decimal numbers or ‘*floats.*' Oh, and if you're a lab member, that's a yes or no, or what we call a ‘*Boolean*'—`True` or `False`!”

**Prof**: "Go ahead—try assigning each detail to a variable. Start with something like `name = 'Your Name'`, `age = 25`, and `height = 1.75`. Oh, and don't forget `is_lab_member = True`—we have to keep track of the VIPs around here!"

Once the player enters their details (what is needed is shown on id station screen or the task specification area), Prof encourages them to do a conversion.

**Prof**: "Perfect! Now, just for fun, let's see how your weight would look in pounds. You can do that by converting it—type `weight_pounds = int(weight * 2.20462)`. Easy, right?"

After the weight conversion, Prof offers a similar task, but this time doesn't give the exact answer.

**Prof**: "And hey, while we're at it, why not convert your body temperature to Fahrenheit, too? Just a little challenge for you. Think about it: if Celsius goes up by 1 degree, Fahrenheit should go up by a bit more. I'm sure you'll figure out the formula!" (Hint 1: Multiply by 1.8 and add 32, Hint 2: `body_temperature_fahrenheit = body_temperature * 1.8 + 32`)

After the player successfully completes the conversions, the ID Station displays a digital ID card with all their entered info, showing variable types clearly. Prof appears, clearly impressed.

**Prof**: "Now that's a proper lab ID! You've handled strings, integers, floats, and Booleans like a pro. Next up, let's visit the *storage locker*. It's time to learn about lists so we can keep track of items in the lab. Ready?"


# Level 3: Lists

Scene setup: display a storage locker with no doors (so player can see inside). The locker has 5 compartments initially, labeled with index 0-4, and contains (apple, banana, cup, pen, notebook) in that order.

### 1. Initial introduction:

**Prof** (Task): Welcome to the Storage Locker! In Python, we use lists to keep track of items, just like the compartments here. Each item in a list has its own spot, or index, starting from 0. Let's create a list for the items you see in this locker. Try typing this: `items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cup', 'pen', 'notebook']`.

**Prof**: Nicely done! Now we have a list with everything in the locker. Lists are powerful because they allow us to add, remove, or access items easily. Speaking of which, let's see how we can add something new to the list…

### 2. Adding an item:

**Prof** (Task): Uh-oh! We forgot something -- a pencil. But look at that, we've only got five slots in this locker! Luckily, Python lists aren't bound by physical limits; they can grow as large as we need. Just use append() to add the pencil to the list, and see how it magically fits right in. Type `items.append('pencil')` and let's give it a try!

[The locker expands to accommodate the new item, showing the pencil added at the end.]

**Prof** (Task): Brilliant! The list has taken it in without breaking a sweat. Python lists are quite flexible -- they can hold all kinds of things, not just text. In fact, let's push the boundaries a bit. Try adding the number `42` and the boolean `True` to the list. Use `append()` again, just like with the pencil. Let's see what happens!

[make sure the player use append() instead of directly adding the items to the list]

[The locker now shows the pencil, `42`, and `True` added to the list.]

**Prof**: Fantastic! Now we have text, a number, and even a true/false value in one list. Python lists can hold almost anything! But, of course, sometimes we need to clean up a list…

### 3. Removing an item:

**Prof** (Task): Oh no, the apple has gone bad! We can't keep it in the locker. Let's remove it. Type `items.remove('apple')` and watch that rotten apple disappear!

[The apple vanishes from the locker, and the remaining items shift to fill the space. remove empty slot]

**Prof**: Excellent! Removing items is just as easy as adding them. Now, let's talk about how to access specific items in a list. It's all about using their index…

### 4. Accessing items by index:

**Prof** (Task): Each item in a list has an index. For example, `items[0]` gives you the first item, and `items[1]` gives you the second item. Why don't you try accessing the *fourth* and *fifth* items on your own? Think about the index numbers!

[append to lines to the code block: `fourth_item = `, `fifth_item = `]
[The player fills in the code with `items[3]` and `items[4]`, and the corresponding items are highlighted in the locker.]

**Prof**: Nicely done! Indexing starts from zero, so the fourth item is at `items[3]`. It's a useful way to grab any specific item in a list. But there's an even quicker way to access the last item…


### 5. Accessing the last item:

**Prof** (Task): Here's a useful trick: to access the last item in a list, you can use `-1` as the index. Go ahead and try grabbing the last item using that index.

[append to lines to the code block: `last_item = `]
[The player fills in the code with `items[-1]`, and the last item is highlighted in the locker.]

-- If the player types something like `last_item = items[6]` instead of `items[-1]`…

**Prof**: Hmm, I see what you did there! Using `items[6]` gives you the last item right now, but what if we add or remove something from the list? Then `items[6]` might not point to the last item anymore. Let's try an experiment…

[The locker slots extends out of the screen, so the player can't see the last item anymore.]

**Prof** (Task): Looks like this list is getting a little…long. It's best to use `-1` here to grab the last item without having to count. Go ahead and try `items[-1]` -- you'll get the last item no matter how many are on this never-ending list!

-- End if

**Prof**: Great job! Using `-1` is a handy way to grab the last item without knowing the exact length of the list. Now, let's get these items in order…

### 6. Sorting the list:

**Prof** (Task): Sorting a list is another handy trick. Since our list has different types, sorting won't work as-is. How about creating a new list with only the text items -- 'banana', 'cup', 'pen', 'notebook', and 'pencil' -- and sorting that alphabetically?

[clear the code block and append to lines: `items = ['banana', 'cup', 'pen', 'notebook', 'pencil']`, the visual of the locker changes to reflect the new list]

**Prof** (Task): Great! Now, to sort this new list, we'll use a function called `sort()`. It works a lot like `append()` -- we call it directly on the list, but we don't need to give it any parameters this time. Just type `items.sort()` and see what happens!

[The items in the locker rearrange themselves in alphabetical order.]

**Prof**: Nicely done! Sorting keeps everything in order, which is super helpful when managing long lists.

### Introducing `len()` function:

**Prof** (Task): Now that we have a sorted list, let's see just how long it is. Python has a function called `len()` that lets you find the length of a list -- basically, how many items it has. Give it a try by typing `len(text_items)`. You can even save the result in a variable if you want to use it later!

[append to lines: `list_length = `]

**Prof**: Nice! Now we know this list has exactly `5` items. The `len()` function is great for keeping track of list sizes, especially when they grow or shrink as we add or remove items.


### Nested Lists (Optional):

**Prof** (Task): Alright, let's take it up a notch! Sometimes we need to store lists inside other lists—for instance, each compartment in our locker could hold multiple items. Let's create a new list called locker_contents, where each inner list represents a different compartment. Try making a list like this: `[['banana', 'cup'], ['pen', 'notebook'], ['pencil']]`.

[clear code block, append to lines: `locker_contents = `]
[The locker now shows the new nested list structure.]

**Prof**: Excellent! Now each compartment has its own list of items. This structure is called a nested list. Let's see how we can access individual items within these compartments.

**Prof** (Task): To get a specific item from a nested list, use two sets of brackets -- `[][]`. The first bracket selects the compartment, and the second bracket picks the item inside. For example, `locker_contents[0][1]` would give you `'cup'` from the first compartment. Why don't you try accessing the ***notebook*** from the second compartment?

[append to lines: `notebook = `]

[The player fills in the code with `locker_contents[1][1]`, and the notebook is highlighted in the locker.]

**Prof**: Fantastic work with those nested lists! You've really got the hang of organizing data into different levels. Lists are super handy for keeping track of objects and text.

### Transition to Next Level:

**Prof**: But now, let's switch gears. In this lab, we don't just store data -- we also control things. Take the *Temperature Control Panel*, for example. Here, we adjust and monitor temperature, humidity, and other settings using numbers.

**Prof**: Numbers are different from lists -- they're a bit more precise and require special operations. I'll show you how to increase, decrease, and combine numbers to control the labs environment. Let's head over to the Temperature Control Panel and dive in!
