# Introductory Scene

The game opens with the professor introducing themselves in a quirky, friendly way.

[Prof enters the scene]

**Prof**: "Ah, there you are! Welcome, welcome! I'm Professor PY. This lab is full of wonders and gizmos, but Python is the key to making it all work."

[Prof chuckles or does something quirky, like checking a dusty old book or adjusting their glasses]

**Prof**: "To get started, why don't you head over to that *Terminal*? Just click it—I'll be right here to help you through. Ready? Let's bring this lab to life!"

[The terminal glows or highlights to indicate it's clickable. Once the player clicks, the first level begins.]

# Level 1: Hello, World!

[Prof reappears on screen.] (Maybe just the avatar and a speech bubble)

**Prof**: "Ah, the classic! Before you can command the lab, you've got to make sure it listens! Let's start by printing a simple message. Type exactly this: `print('Hello Lab.')` and hit enter. This command tells the computer to say something. Give it a go!"

The player types the command and hits enter. The terminal responds with 'Hello Lab.' printed on the screen.

The player exits the terminal and returns to the professor. The professor gives feedback. (full body)

**Prof**: "See? You've just spoken to the lab! Well done, truly. Now, I think you're ready for the real work. How about we get you officially set up in the system? Every scientist needs an ID, after all."

**Prof**: "Head over to the Personal ID Station next. You'll enter a few details—just a bit of data for our records—and the lab will generate your official ID card. Ready?"

# Level 2: Variables and Types

[Prof's avatar appears in the screen.]

**Prof**: "Ah, the Personal ID Station—my favorite gadget. So, here's how it works: every bit of information you enter—your name, age, even if you're a member of the lab—is stored as a variable. Each variable has its own type, depending on what it holds."

[Prof gestures animatedly]

**Prof**: "For example, your name is a ‘*string*,' which means it's text. Your age, well, that's a whole number or an ‘*integer*'—like 25. And then there's your height and weight, which are decimal numbers or ‘*floats.*' Oh, and if you're a lab member, that's a yes or no, or what we call a ‘*Boolean*'—`True` or `False`!”

**Prof**: "Go ahead—try assigning each detail to a variable. Start with something like `name = 'Your Name'`, `age = 25`, and `height = 1.75`. Oh, and don't forget `is_lab_member = True`—we have to keep track of the VIPs around here!"

Once the player enters their details (what is needed is shown on id station screen or the task specification area), Prof encourages them to do a conversion.

**Prof**: "Perfect! Now, just for fun, let's see how your weight would look in pounds. You can do that by converting it—type `weight_pounds = int(weight * 2.20462)`. Easy, right?"

After the weight conversion, Prof offers a similar task, but this time doesn't give the exact answer.

**Prof**: "And hey, while we're at it, why not convert your body temperature to Fahrenheit, too? Just a little challenge for you. Think about it: if Celsius goes up by 1 degree, Fahrenheit should go up by a bit more. I'm sure you'll figure out the formula!" (Hint 1: Multiply by 1.8 and add 32, Hint 2: `body_temperature_fahrenheit = body_temperature * 1.8 + 32`)

After the player successfully completes the conversions, the ID Station displays a digital ID card with all their entered info, showing variable types clearly. Prof appears, clearly impressed.

**Prof**: "Now that's a proper lab ID! You've handled strings, integers, floats, and Booleans like a pro. Next up, let's visit the *storage locker*. It's time to learn about lists so we can keep track of items in the lab. Ready?"


# Level 3: Lists

Scene setup: display a storage locker with no doors (so player can see inside). The locker has 5 compartments initially, labeled with index 0-4, and contains (apple, banana, cup, pen, notebook) in that order.

### 1. Initial introduction:

**Prof** (Task): Welcome to the Storage Locker! In Python, we use lists to keep track of items, just like the compartments here. Each item in a list has its own spot, or index, starting from 0. Let's create a list for the items you see in this locker. Try typing this: `items = ['apple', 'banana', 'cup', 'pen', 'notebook']`.

**Prof**: Nicely done! Now we have a list with everything in the locker. Lists are powerful because they allow us to add, remove, or access items easily. Speaking of which, let's see how we can add something new to the list…

### 2. Adding an item:

**Prof** (Task): Uh-oh! We forgot something -- a pencil. But look at that, we've only got five slots in this locker! Luckily, Python lists aren't bound by physical limits; they can grow as large as we need. Just use append() to add the pencil to the list, and see how it magically fits right in. Type `items.append('pencil')` and let's give it a try!

[The locker expands to accommodate the new item, showing the pencil added at the end.]

**Prof** (Task): Brilliant! The list has taken it in without breaking a sweat. Python lists are quite flexible -- they can hold all kinds of things, not just text. In fact, let's push the boundaries a bit. Try adding the number `42` and the boolean `True` to the list. Use `append()` again, just like with the pencil. Let's see what happens!

[make sure the player use append() instead of directly adding the items to the list]

[The locker now shows the pencil, `42`, and `True` added to the list.]

**Prof**: Fantastic! Now we have text, a number, and even a true/false value in one list. Python lists can hold almost anything! But, of course, sometimes we need to clean up a list…

### 3. Removing an item:

**Prof** (Task): Oh no, the apple has gone bad! We can't keep it in the locker. Let's remove it. Type `items.remove('apple')` and watch that rotten apple disappear!

[The apple vanishes from the locker, and the remaining items shift to fill the space. remove empty slot]

**Prof**: Excellent! Removing items is just as easy as adding them. Now, let's talk about how to access specific items in a list. It's all about using their index…

### 4. Accessing items by index:

**Prof** (Task): Each item in a list has an index. For example, `items[0]` gives you the first item, and `items[1]` gives you the second item. Why don't you try accessing the *fourth* and *fifth* items on your own? Think about the index numbers!

[append to lines to the code block: `fourth_item = `, `fifth_item = `]
[The player fills in the code with `items[3]` and `items[4]`, and the corresponding items are highlighted in the locker.]

**Prof**: Nicely done! Indexing starts from zero, so the fourth item is at `items[3]`. It's a useful way to grab any specific item in a list...

**Prof**: Wait... do you hear that? The Hot Gas Chambers are acting up again! The system’s out of sync, and the control panel is flashing red. Quick, let’s head over to the chambers! We need to fix this before the system overloads. Follow me!


# Level 4: Pressure Calibration  

**Scene Setup:**  
The lab’s **Hot Gas Chambers** are malfunctioning, and the control panel displays critical information:  

1. `temperature_left`: 200  
2. `temperature_right`: 300  
3. `pressure`: 'Calibration Required'  
4. `humidity`: 80
5. `last_log`: ""  
6. `session_logs`: []
7. `all_logs`: ["System Initialized", "Temperature Adjusted", "Humidity Set",  "Unbalanced Chambers Detected"]

Show flickering red on screen.

### 1. Balancing Chamber Temperatures  

**Prof** (Task):  
The Hot Gas Chambers are out of sync! One chamber is at 200°C, and the other is at 300°C. To stabilize them, we need to calculate the average temperature of both chambers and assign it to `target_temperature`. 
Which is to say, we need to add the temperatures of the left and right chambers together and then divide the result by 2. This will give us the balanced target temperature. Let’s do it! Remember, Python uses `/` for division, and don't forget to use parentheses to ensure the correct order of operations.

**Code Prompt:**  
`target_temperature = `  

[The player types: `(temperature_left + temperature_right) / 2`]

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `temperature_left`: 200 -> 250
  - `temperature_right`: 300 -> 250
  - `last_log`: "Adjusted chambers to"
  - `session_logs`: ["Adjusted chambers to"]

- The red flickering on the screen stops.

**Prof**: Nicely done! The temperatures are now balanced, and the chambers are stabilizing. But look at that log—it’s incomplete! Let’s fix it next.

---

### 2. Fixing a Broken Log  

**Prof** (Task):  
The operation log is incomplete—it says nothing useful. Let’s update it to say what we just did! Start by adding 'Adjusted chambers to 250C' to `last_log`. Use string concatenation to do this.

**Code Prompt:**  
`last_log = `

[The player types: `last_log = last_log + "250C"`]

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `last_log`: "Balanced chambers to 250C"  
  - `session_logs`: ["Adjusted chambers to 250C"]

**Prof**: Great! But wait—this log is still missing a period. Let’s fix that using a simpler method. 

---

### 3. Simplifying Updates with `+=`  

**Prof** (Task):  
Instead of writing `x = x + y` again, let’s use the shorthand `+=`. Add a period (".") to `last_log` using this shortcut.

**Code Prompt:**  
`last_log += `  

[The player types: `last_log += "."`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `last_log`: "Balanced chambers to 250C."  
  - `session_logs`: ["Adjusted chambers to 250C"]

**Prof**: Perfect! The log looks much better now. Let’s move on to that flickering pressure gauge.

---

### 4. Pressure Calibration with Modulo  

**Prof** (Task):  
The pressure gauge needs recalibration. We’ll calculate a new pressure value based on the temperature and humidity using this formula:

`calibrated_pressure = (temperature_left + humidity * 2) / 5 - 2`  

This involves addition, multiplication, division, and subtraction. Let’s calculate the pressure.

**Code Prompt:**  
`calibrated_pressure = `  

[The player types: `(temperature_left + humidity * 2) / 5 - 2`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `calibrated_pressure`: (calculated value, e.g., 80)  
  - `pressure`: "80 (Error: Invalid Pressure)"  

**Prof**: Hmm… the pressure value is calculated, but the gauge still says 'Error: Invalid Pressure.' Oh! I forgot—the system only accepts pressures divisible by 3. Let’s check if our pressure is valid using the modulo operator (`%`).

**Code Prompt:**  
`remainder = calibrated_pressure % 3`  

[The player types: `remainder = calibrated_pressure % 3`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `pressure`: "80 (Error: Invalid Pressure), Remainder: 2"

**Prof**: The remainder is 2! That’s why the gauge is rejecting it. To fix this, subtract the remainder from the current pressure. You can use the shorthand `-=` to make the adjustment.

**Code Prompt:**  
`calibrated_pressure -= `  

[The player types: `calibrated_pressure -= remainder`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:   
  - `pressure`:  (adjusted value, e.g., 78)  
  - `last_log`: "Pressure calibrated successfully."
  - `session_logs`: ["Adjusted chambers to 250C", "Pressure calibrated successfully."]

**Prof**: Fantastic! The pressure is now calibrated, and the system is happy. Modulo is such a useful tool for cyclic checks like this. Let’s move on to the log scale readings.

---

### 5. Exponentiation for Log Scale  

**Prof** (Task):  
The Left Chamber seems stable, but let’s calculate some properties to ensure it complies with safety regulations. Since it’s a cube, we’ll calculate the area of one side and the total volume. I remember that the volume must stay between 900 and 1200 units³ to comply with safety regulations.*"  
The side length of the Left Chamber is 10 units. The formulas are simple:
- *One Side’s Surface Area: `side_length^2`*  
- *Volume of a cube: `side_length^3`*  

Let’s use exponentiation (`**`) to perform these calculations.

**Code Prompt:**  
`side_length = 10`
`# Calculate side_area and volume`
`side_area = `
`volume = `

[The player types:  
`side_area = side_length ** 2`  
`volume = side_length ** 3`]

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `side_area`: 100  
  - `volume`: 1000  

**Prof**: Fantastic! The Left Chamber has a side area of 100 units² and a volume of 1000 units³. The volume is within the safety range. We can confidently proceed to the next task!

### 6. Repeating Messages with `str * n`  

**Prof** (Task):  
Let’s notify maintenance that the system is fixed. To make sure they notice, let’s repeat the message three times! Use the `*` operator to repeat the string.

**Code Prompt:**  
`message = "System fixed! " * 3`  

[The player types: `message = "System fixed! " * 3`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `message`: "System fixed! System fixed! System fixed!"  

**Prof**: Excellent! I think they’ll get the message now. Let’s move on to logging everything we’ve done.

---

### 7. Adding Logs to a Master List  

**Prof** (Task):  
We’ve been keeping a list of recent operations in `session_logs`. Let’s merge this into the master log, `all_logs`, to maintain a full record of everything we’ve done. Use `+=` to combine the lists. Don't forget to set `session_logs` back to an empty list after merging.

**Code Prompt:**  
`all_logs `  

[The player types: `all_logs += session_logs` and `session_logs = []`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `all_logs`: ["System Initialized.", "Temperature Adjusted.", "Humidity Set.", "Unbalanced Chambers Detected!", "Balanced chambers to 250C.", "Pressure Calibrated Successfully."]
  - `session_logs`: []

**Prof**: Perfect! All our logs are now stored in one place. It’s great for keeping track of everything we’ve done.

---

### 8. Repeating Lists with `[a, b, c] * n`  

**Prof** (Task):  
Before we finish, let’s create a repeating pattern of operations for system testing. Create a list with two operations—`'temp_adjust'` and `'pressure_adjust'`—and repeat it three times.

**Code Prompt:**  
`test_pattern = ["temp_adjust", "pressure_adjust"] * 3`  

[The player types: `test_pattern = ["temp_adjust", "pressure_adjust"] * 3`]  

**Feedback:**  
- The dynamic panel updates:  
  - `test_pattern`: ["temp_adjust", "pressure_adjust", "temp_adjust", "pressure_adjust", "temp_adjust", "pressure_adjust"]  

**Prof**: Fantastic! This repeating pattern will help us test the system’s stability...

**Prof**: Amazing work! You’ve balanced temperatures, calibrated pressures, logged operations, and even created repeating sequences. You’ve mastered Python’s basic operations! Next up, we’ll make the system smarter with conditional logic. Ready to level up?
